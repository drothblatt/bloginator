Guide
-----
Upon loading the page, one will be able to view all posts and comments made by users of the site. To write posts and comment, it is necessary to create an account and/or login. Buttons to redirect to the account creation and login pages can be found at the top of the home page. Once one is logged in, the buttons avaiable to the user will be to "Write Post", "Comment", and "Logout". By clicking "Write Post", one will be redirected to a page where they can input a title and body for their post. A similar process occurs when a "Comment" button is pressed.
